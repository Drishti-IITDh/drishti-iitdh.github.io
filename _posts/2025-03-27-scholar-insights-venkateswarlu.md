### 1.	Can you give a brief introduction of yourself?
I am Dr. Venkateswarlu Gudepu (Venkatesh), currently working as a Research Associate at the **University of Texas at Dallas (UTD)**. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad (IIT Dharwad), India. My research focuses on 5G and Beyond Networks, Open RAN (O-RAN), AI/ML-driven network optimization, and energy efficiency in B5G networks.
Beyond my technical research, I am deeply involved in mentorship, linguistic studies, and social activities, which have significantly shaped both my personal and professional journey.
<br><br>

### 2.	What inspired you to pursue PhD? Did your interest develop gradually, or was it something you had planned from the beginning?
My journey into research was not something I had planned from the beginning. I was born and brought up in a poor family in a remote village in Andhra Pradesh, where education was never a priority. Growing up, my teachers and mentors recognized my potential and constantly encouraged me to pursue higher studies.
During my undergraduate years at the **RGUKT-Nuzvid (International Institute of Information Technology -Nuzvid)**, I developed a passion for problem-solving and innovative thinking. However, the real turning point came during my M.Tech at the National Institute of Technology Uttarakhand (NIT Uttarakhand), where I was introduced to AI/ML applications in telecommunications. I was eager to explore how AI/ML could be used to optimize networks, but I needed a structured research platform.
My Ph.D. supervisor, Professor Kondepu, played a crucial role in guiding me toward this domain. He helped me identify the real-world applications of AI/ML in Telecom, which motivated me to pursue a Ph.D. in this emerging field.
<br><br>

### 3.	 Can you share some highlights of your PhD journey? 
My Ph.D. journey at IIT Dharwad was both challenging and rewarding. Some of the major highlights include:<br>

• Recipient of the Protsahan Award for research excellence (IEEE Bangalore)<br>
• Hackfest Winner (3rd place) at ETSI TeraFlow, NetSoft, Spain<br>
• Secured multiple research travel grants (COMSNETS 2023, NetSoft 2023, ANTS 2022, 2023)<br>
• Shortlisted for prestigious research schools: ARTIST School (Italy), 5G International Ph.D. School (Italy)<br>
• Delivered a Talk at IEEE OPEN RAN, 6G, and Rapid Reaction Standardization Activity (RRSA), Johns Hopkins University<br>
• Collaborated with international researchers in alignment with O-RAN Alliance and next-generation mobile networks<br>
• Published research papers in top-tier conferences and journals<br> 
• Had the opportunity to meet and interact with leading scholars and researchers in the field<br>
• First Ph.D. Graduate in CSE at IIT Dharwad<br>

My research contributed significantly to the development of energy-efficient telecom solutions, particularly in O-RAN and AI-driven network optimization.
<br><br>

### 4.	How did you handle the pressure and demands of research, publishing, and maintaining work-life balance?
Balancing research, publications, and personal commitments was demanding, but I managed it through discipline and time management (difficult in the beginning days). Some strategies that helped me include:<br>

• **Setting Clear Goals**: Breaking down my research into milestones and maintaining weekly progress reports kept me on track.<br>
• **Seeking Mentorship**: Regular discussions with professors, senior researchers, and peers helped refine my research approach and changed my perspective towards Ph.D. Journey.<br>
• **Faith and Mental Resilience**: I always believed in giving my best and leaving the rest to God's grace. This mindset gave me peace during stressful times.<br>
• **Taking Breaks**: Engaging in non-academic activities, such as reading the books, mentoring students, and social activities like reaching out to the orphanages, helped me maintain balance.<br>
• **Support System**: Talking to family and friends about my struggles and seeking their support gave me strength to keep moving forward.<br>


### 5.	Would you like to share any interesting experiences you had regarding conferences/ presentations or publications you participated in as part of your research?
One of the most memorable experiences during my Ph.D. was presenting my research at various domestic and international conferences and interacting with leading experts in the field.
Another significant learning experience came when my first research paper was rejected. Initially, I was disappointed, but I quickly learned that **rejection is just an opportunity for improvement**. The feedback I received helped me refine my work, and I eventually got my research published.
I also had the privilege of attending renowned international research schools, where I connected with scholars worldwide, gaining new perspectives and ideas.
<br><br>

### 6.	What is your typical day like as a research scholar? How do you spend your time outside of academics? Are there hobbies or interests that keep you grounded?
A typical day during my Ph.D. involved:<br>
8:00 AM – 3:00 AM:

    • Reviewing my research goals and tracking progress.<br>
    • Meetings with my advisor, collaborating with teams, and implementing research findings.<br>
    • Coding, testing, debugging, and preparing research manuscripts.<br>
    • Taking short breaks to read the books, mentor students, or outings with roommates.<br>
  

### 7.	Who or what has been your biggest source of inspiration throughout your academic journey?
I strongly believe that education enlightens the mind and creates opportunities. Coming from a background where education was undervalued, I became the first person from my village to pursue undergraduate and postgraduate studies.
I owe much of my success to my school teachers, mentors, and Prof. Kondepu, who extended his support in all the possible ways. Their selfless support and encouragement inspired me to work hard and contribute to academia.
Additionally, seeing my research solving real-world problems continues to motivate me.
<br><br>

### 8.	What motivated you to pursue a Postdoctoral program? Can you share your academic and professional journey leading up to your current role at university of Texas at Dallas?
Pursuing a Postdoc allows me to deepen my research expertise and work on cutting-edge projects. After my Ph.D., I received an offer from UT Dallas to work as a Research Associate, where I collaborate with leading telecom industry vendors on AI-driven O-RAN solutions.
My journey from struggling to afford education to becoming a Research Associate in the U.S. is purely by God’s grace and the guidance of great mentors.
<br><br>

### 9.	How do you view the experience of studying and researching abroad? What are your expectations regarding cultural and academic diversity?
Moving to the U.S. for research was a significant transition, but the experience has been enriching. Key takeaways:

• **Highly Collaborative**: Access to top researchers, industry partnerships, and cutting-edge resources.
• **Diverse & Inclusive**: Engaging with people from various cultural and academic backgrounds has broadened my perspective.
• **Technology-Driven**: The advanced research infrastructure enables innovation at an accelerated pace.
<br>
I aim to grow academically, contribute meaningfully, and mentor students who come from challenging backgrounds like mine.


### 10. What message would you like to share with students aspiring to follow in your footsteps?
For students looking to pursue research and higher studies, here’s my advice:<br>
1.	**Focus on What Matters**: Look for what is important rather than what you are interested in. (Note: Don’t ignore your interest because one fine day your interest may be important to field and society)
2.	**Seek Mentors**: Guidance from the right people can transform your journey. Finding the right mentors at the right time, in the right place, and making the right decisions can shape your path to success.
3.	**Be Resilient**: Failures are part of the process—learn from them.
4.	**Keep Learning**: Stay updated with the latest trends and technologies. Everyday for 30-60 minutes, go through the recent works in your field.
5.	**Stay Grounded**: Faith, discipline, and consistency will take you far.

Above all, **give your best in everything you do, and trust in the Lord God Almighty with your whole heart**!
