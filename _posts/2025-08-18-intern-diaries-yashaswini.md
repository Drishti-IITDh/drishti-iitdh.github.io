### Introduction

Hello, I am Yashaswini, a 3rd-year Computer Science and Engineering student. I am passionate about the rapidly growing tech world and recently interned at Redbus, gaining valuable industry exposure. I am also a member of the AI Club and actively pursue basketball, dance, and hackathons. I have secured 2nd place in Build-a-Bot, contributed to several web development projects, and been part of the Parsec organising team. I enjoy continuous learning, exploring new opportunities, and balancing academics with extracurriculars.

###  How did you find/secure this internship?

I got it through a referral from the HR of the company through my connections.

### What was your project about and what was your role in it?

* **Leveraging Visual AI models to extract critical metadata** from Indonesian promotional TikTok videos, providing actionable insights for the marketing team, **discovering and utilizing the HelixDB graph vector database**.
* Building a **simple UI with HelixDB as the backend using the company data** and **transforming data into Nomic vector embeddings** to power fast and accurate vector similarity searches.

### What was your typical day like during the internship?

I used to go to office at convenient timings like 10:00am, there were no strict rules to it.
After reaching I used to grab a cup of filter coffee and biscuits /mixtures. Then I would gear up for work.
At 1:30 in the afternoon, me and my team would head towards cafeteria for lunch. After having our lunch we used to go to the game zone where we played on a gaming console. We also played table tennis, carom ,etc.
After that we would work till 6:30 pm and then check out and go home.

### Did you learn any new skills or tools during the internship?

* Collaborated closely with the Senior Marketing Manager and the Senior Data Engineer, gaining exposure to real-world **product and marketing strategy discussions**.
* Improved my confidence, public speaking, and communication skills through **regular meetings and presentations**.
* **Networking and exchanging ideas** with fellow interns from IIT Delhi, SRM and other reputed institutions — fostering a great learning and collaborative environment.

### How has this internship influenced your career goals or interests?

I got an opportunity to network with HRs, Managers who were impressed by my work and they have invited me and have urged me to consider joining RedBus for full time roles after my 4th year of college.

### What advice would you give to students preparing for internships?

Students should grind their **DSA coding/Machine Learning/WebDev skills**. Once you step out into the corporate world , your CPI doesn't hold prominence, instead skills matter like your communication/presentation skills.
Keep applying to many internships, stay active on LinkedIn, try to get in touch with HRs, and most importantly stay motivated, and keep giving your best.

### Anything else you would like to share about your journey?

This internship gave me a good exposure to the corporate world and helped me discover where my interest lies. I enjoyed it.
