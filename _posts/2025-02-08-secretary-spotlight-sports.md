## Interview with the General Secretary of Sports and Athletics

### Flipcards

```markdown
<details>
<summary>What are the updates on the initiatives mentioned in the manifesto? What have been accomplished so far?</summary>
Temporary courts for basketball, volleyball, tennis; a common ground for football, cricket, and hockey, along with a dedicated running track will be completed by the end of February. Successfully onboarded coaches for athletics, hockey, football, and badminton. Working to recruit coaches for weightlifting, squash, tennis, and table tennis for proper training. Decided to use the leftover amount from this year's Gymkhana budget to cover the swimming pool's maintenance costs for the next year. The inter-IIT athletics team received transportation to the RN Shetty Synthetic Track in Dharwad for training sessions and also for practice sessions and matches with other institutes and clubs.

<details>
<summary>You did draft an email outlining the "Procedure for Addressing Queries, Requirements, or Questions Related to Sports," how was the feedback?</summary>
Feedback was moderately positive but not entirely sufficient to improve the management of the sports council.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the challenges you faced from the students' side as well as the authorities' side?</summary>
**Authorities' side:**
- Need to follow government regulations for purchasing and construction, leading to significant delays, such as those experienced with the temporary ground.
- Inefficiencies in the higher management system that require improvement.

**Students' side:**
- Low participation in sports activities.
- While the lack of outdoor playgrounds may contribute, there is also a noticeable low attendance at indoor practice sessions led by hired coaches.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some of the strategies you implemented to ensure that all students are provided with equal opportunities to participate in their chosen sports?</summary>
Ensured that all students were provided with equal opportunities to participate in their chosen sports, which involved making coaches available to all students without any restrictions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Have you hosted any competitions or are you planning to organize any in the near future?</summary>
On Sports Day, hosted competitions for indoor sports such as table tennis, badminton, and a marathon. Were unable to host more competitions for outdoor sports last semester due to the unavailability of grounds in PC. However, as we will have a temporary playground available by the end of February, we are planning to organize the GC this semester accordingly.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How was the overall participation of students in sport-related activities (like Inter IIT) this year?</summary>
Not up to the mark and needs improvement.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can we improve participation from students?</summary>
Sports culture on campus needs to be nurtured. Seniors should take the initiative to guide juniors and encourage them to participate in outdoor activities, including sports as well as other extracurricular activities, alongside their academics. There should be cooperation and enthusiasm from the juniors. Improving sports facilities, such as better playgrounds and recruiting qualified coaches.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Any message or advice to the incoming General Secretary for Sports and Athletics (GSSA)?</summary>
First and foremost, taking on this responsibility requires resilience, dedication, and a willingness to invest proper time and effort to sustain the current growth phase of the sports culture in our developing institute. Primary focus should be on fostering the sports culture by motivating students to actively participate in sports activities and organizing various competitions to engage them.

## ðŸ“Š "The Secretary Spotlight" Survey

In January, Drishti conducted the "The Secretary Spotlight" Survey, which sought to assess the students' contentment with the General Secretaries and their overall operations in a more in-depth manner than the typical manifestos. A total of 80 participants took part in the survey.
