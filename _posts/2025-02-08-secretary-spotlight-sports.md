Decided to use the leftover amount from this year's Gymkhana budget to cover the swimming pool's maintenance costs for the next year. The inter-IIT athletics team received transportation to the RN Shetty Synthetic Track in Dharwad for training sessions and also for practice sessions and matches with other institutes and clubs.</h2>
