During my academic journey, I have faced several challenges, both technical and personal, that have played a significant role in shaping my growth.

One of the major **technical challenges** was adapting to a new area of research. The field I entered was unfamiliar, and it took time to build a solid understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of the concepts involved.

Another challenge I encountered was **bridging the gap between the education systems of my home country and India**. The syllabus, teaching methods, and academic expectations were quite different, which required me to adjust to new learning approaches and standards. Navigating these differences while maintaining the quality of my work was a unique challenge.

The challenge on the personal part came when I had to **adjust to cultural differences**, including the food and lifestyle in India. As an international student, I initially struggled with local food, and the language barrier also made it difficult to understand some of the local English accents and academic phrasing. Over time, I became more accustomed to the local cuisine and gained more confidence in my communication skills.

**Homesickness was another personal challenge** I had to cope with. Unlike many others, I couldn't visit home frequently due to the distance, travel logistics, and the need to navigate permissions and regulations in my home country. This made me miss family events and important occasions. Despite these difficulties, I maintained regular communication with my family through video calls and messaging, which helped alleviate the feeling of distance.

Despite these challenges, I have learned to adapt, and they have strengthened my resolve to focus on both my academic and personal growth. I continue to make the most of the opportunities available at IIT Dharwad, and I appreciate the unique experience of studying here in India.

#### 10. If you were to pitch Mathematics in general or Graph Theory in particular to a curious onlooker, how would you do it?

Mathematics is often described as the **“language of the universe”** because no one can avoid it, as it plays a role in everything: from the smallest tasks to the biggest challenges in our daily lives. Whether we are aware of it or not, math is involved in the decisions we make, the technology we use, and even the natural phenomena we encounter. It is the foundation that helps us understand the world around us and solve problems in nearly every aspect of our environment.

**Graph Theory**, in particular, it is like **the art of connecting the dots** literally! This branch of mathematics helps us understand various networks, including social connections, transportation routes, molecular interactions, and the structure of the Internet. Hence, it is present and useful in many areas in real life such that how cities are linked by way (road, train, etc.), how social networks connect millions of people, how data flows through the internet and something like that.

Therefore, it is like as a powerful tool for understanding the world around us by analyzing networks and connections, improving how we approach and interact with systems, and solving complex, real-world challenges. If you’ve ever wondered how Google delivers the best search results, how GPS calculates the shortest route, or how to cover a chessboard using knights' moves, you have already experienced the power of Graph Theory. It is a field where **creativity meets logic**, **making every problem feel like an exciting puzzle** waiting to be solved.
<br><br>

#### 11. What is your million-dollar advice to anyone who wants to pursue research? Any message you want to leave for the “curious onlooker”...

As per my knowledge, **research is not just about finding answers. It is fundamentally about asking the right questions and being patient in the process**.

It is a journey that primarily requires curiosity to guide you and persistence to drive you forward. Sometimes, the most important step is recognizing that **failure is not the opposite of success. It’s a part of the journey, not the destination**. At times, you may feel stuck—that too is just one of the many challenges along the way. *Every setback, every challenge is your opportunity to learn and refine your approach*. _Keep an open mind to insights from various fields, and most importantly, take joy in the process_.

_When you are passionate about what you do, it transforms the endeavour from work into a fulfilling pursuit_.
