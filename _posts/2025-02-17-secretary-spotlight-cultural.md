#### 1.Transparency in Managing Event Funds

The cultural council maintained meticulous records of all approved budgets, expenses, and funds
collected from students. These records, along with supporting bills and expense proofs, were
submitted to both the treasurer and the Students' Welfare Office, ensuring they were accessible to
any student for review. Additionally, I personally addressed student inquiries regarding expenses
through email, sharing detailed breakdowns whenever requested. We were, and absolutely will be,
committed to transparency and ensuring accountability in fund management.

#### 2. New Events and Competitions Introduced

Under my leadership, the cultural council introduced several new and vibrant events, including a
Dahi Handi celebration, an authentic Ganesh Chaturthi event, and a traditional Garbha night. We
also revived the General Championship (Inter-Branch) competitions, which had been discontinued
the previous year. Furthermore, we organized a Christmas workshop and hosted the SPICMACAY
regional conference, bringing classical Indian cultural activities to our campus. These initiatives
enriched the cultural landscape of the institute and catered to diverse student interests.

#### 3. Timely and Inclusive Events

To ensure smooth execution, an events calendar was meticulously planned at the start of the
semester, taking into account the cultural and religious significance of various activities and their
respective budgets. While cultural competitions were occasionally delayed to accommodate other
events, every planned activity was eventually conducted. From classical workshops to modern art
forms, the events spanned a wide range of interests, encouraging maximum participation. We also
enhanced the campus ambiance with decorations that added to the cultural vibe, leaving students
mesmerized by the festivities.

#### 4. Unbiased Selections for Contingents

Selections for contingents were conducted with utmost fairness. Only students with proven merit in
previously held college events or significant expertise in their field were chosen to represent IIT
Dharwad. This ensured that our representatives were well-qualified and adequately prepared for
external competitions.

#### 5. Cultural Collaborations

The cultural council actively collaborated with a variety of organizations and groups to enhance the
cultural experience on campus. We worked closely with the sports office and invited campus
security and NCC/NSS volunteers to assist in the seamless execution of patriotic celebrations such
as Independence Day and Republic Day. These collaborations ensured the events were conducted
smoothly while fostering a sense of unity and national pride.
Furthermore, we partnered with SPICMACAY to host Indian classical workshops and engaged local
businesses for event decorations and entertainment setups. We also encouraged students to take
initiative in organizing culturally significant events like Kannada Rajyotsava, Christmas, and Easter
celebrations. Workshops promoting traditional languages such as Sanskrit and external judges
invited for their expertise added further value to our cultural activities.

#### 6. Workshops and Training Sessions

Workshops were a cornerstone of our preparation strategy. We organized sessions to train
participants for Inter-IIT competitions, Garbha dances, and music performances. SPICMACAY
workshops exposed students to the rich heritage of Indian classical arts, ensuring that cultural
appreciation and preparation went hand in hand.

#### 7. Contributions to a Vibrant Campus Culture

When I took office, student participation in cultural activities was minimal. Through consistent
planning and execution of regular events, the council created a buzz around campus. Our efforts
significantly increased student engagement, and many now eagerly anticipate future cultural
activities. This transformation has made IIT Dharwad a more vibrant and culturally active space.

#### 8. Challenges and Solutions

One of the primary challenges was obtaining timely approvals from the concerned authorities, which
often led to event delays or cancellations, particularly for club-led initiatives. Even after approvals,
payment delays disrupted event planning and execution. Despite these hurdles, we improvised and
ensured that most events were conducted successfully. Moving forward, I hope these administrative
processes are streamlined to enable smoother cultural operations.
